David\n\t\twas a very bad dancer, always trod on one\'s toes\n\t\tand I remember he once crushed the metatarsal\n\t\tbones in the foot of a girlfriend of mine - discreet\n\t\tlesbianism was fashionable at the time.\n\t\tHere\'s a photograph of Noel Coward - darling\n\t\tNoel as we always called him.

Later when Claude and I went to\n\t\tIndia to take up the Vice-regency I met Gandhi\n\t\twith whom I used to play French cricket - he\n\t\twas awfully good at cricket, as a matter of fact,\n\t\tClaude always used to say ""what the loin-cloth\n\t\ttrade gained, the wicket-keeping trade lost.""\n\t\tPandit Nerhu was very impressive too, though if\n\t\tEdwina Mountbatten is to be believed his length\n\t\twas too variable for him ever to enter the ranks\n\t\tof Indian leg-spin immortals.

jobs,"[{'speaker': 'direction', 'text': 'Hugh addresses the camera:'}, {'speaker': 'Hugh', 'text': ""\n\tHm. Yes. Jobs. I've had a variety of jobs since\n\t\tI moved to London. I started off, let me see,\n\t\trunning a mobile twenty-four hour discotheque,\n\t\tfor the St John's Ambulance Brigade, for when\n\t\tthey had those big functions, and they needed a\n\t\tdiscotheque standing by, just in case. And then after\n\t\tthat I set up as a freelance nudist, doing odds and\n\t\tends, weddings, supermarket openings, that sort of\n\t\tthing. A lot of work for Securicor, funnily enough.\n\t\tBut then there was the great nudism crash of '87\n\t\tand I got in with a removals firm in Notting Hill,\n\t\tdoing a job for an Iraqi diplomat called Nigel Havers.\n\t\tYou can imagine the stick he used to get, having the\n\t\tsame name as Nigel Havers. But he was a nice chap,\n\t\tand we moved house for him. He wanted his house\n\t\tmoved to the end of the street, because he said it\n\t\twas easier to park there. Funny things was that by\n\t\tthe time we'd finished, and put the last slate back\n\t\ton the roof, an Austin 1100 went and parked in the\n\t\tspace in front of the house, so we had to move it\n\t\tall back again. Happy days, though. And then, let's\n\t\tsee, I had a couple of months in the white slave\n\t\ttrade - on the selling side, I should point out. Just\n\t\ton the telephone, really, it was mostly mail order\n\t\twork, pretty dull, but it did get me into my next\n\t\tjob which was director of pharmaceutical research\n\t\tat ICI. God knows how I got it, because I don't\n\t\tknow the first thing about drugs, although I was\n\t\tpretty good in the interview. But they rumbled me\n\t\teventually. All I could think of to say was that the\n\t\tpills ought to be oblong instead of round, and after\n\t\ta couple of years of that they threw me out. Then\n\t\tI thought I needed a break so I joined a group of\n\t\ttravelling loss adjusters. They used to tour round\n\t\tthe seaside resorts every summer putting on loss\n\t\tadjusting shows for children. That was very good\n\t\tfun, although I used to drink far too much. God\n\t\tthose loss adjusters can stick it away. Unbelievable.\n\t\tThen I was Princess Anne's assistant for a while, but\n\t\tI chucked that in because it was obvious they were\n\t\tnever going to make me Princess Anne, no matter\n\t\thow well I did the job.

fast_monologue,"[{'speaker': 'direction', 'text': 'Stephen, in huge close-up, monologises at really quite ripsnortingly immense speed.'}, {'speaker': 'Stephen', 'text': '\n\tWhen I was seventeen I had already tried fourteen different\n\t\tjobs, married twice, fathered many many many children, eaten a\n\t\tperfectly enormous quantity of food over a long time period,\n\t\tbeen weaned off six types of class A dangerous drugs, given up\n\t\tsmoking, taken it up again, given it up again, taken it up\n\t\tagain, given taking it up and taken giving it up again and\n\t\tagain and again. By the time I was twenty, alcohol had never\n\t\tpassed my lips, yet I was a reckless and predatory alcoholic:\n\t\tmy life was in pieces, my marriages were shattered, my children\n\t\tlay in ruins, my coffee was tasting incredibily bitter, I was\n\t\tpaying alimony along the sinuses, behind the dark interior\n\t\tpassages of the skull and through the nose. Nothing smelt felt\n\t\tdealt me right. My friends, ha! Friends? Friends, more like. My\n\t\tfriends shunned me as you might shun a cigarette lighter or a\n\t\tbrown caravan. In my twenty-fourth year I had increasing\n\t\tproblems coping with live music. I lost my sense of utterness,\n\t\tand all feeling and movement in both testicles. Testicles? Did\n\t\tI say testicles? Testicles, more like. Rashes came and went:\n\t\tmore wives, more children. My first daughter was severalteen by\n\t\tthis time and inclined to chat. Nothing, nothing had prepared\n\t\tme for this. Life, they call it. Life? Life? Life? A living\n\t\tlife, I called it. Desire, mood, memory, heat, sweat, effort,\n\t\tpower, diction and a great quadratic equation of violent\n\t\twanting, needing and rinsing. Words tumbled from me then as I\n\t\tknew that the answer lay, not in poetry, not in music, art,\n\t\tsculpture, drama, dance or investment analysis. The answer lay\n\t\tin a new way. A new way on. Some infection gripped me by the\n\t\tkidneys and said ""a new way, Randall, a new way"". So still\n\t\tbarely twenty-five and three-quarters I rode that mountain, I\n\t\ttrod that vineyard, I slept that great sleep of destiny, I\n\t\tdanced to that music of memory and pogoed my soul to the insane\n\t\trhythms of the heart\'s mind\'s vapid texture of journeys.\n\t\tJourneys? Gurneys more like. No, journeys, I was right. Still\n\t\tthe fat gathered to my sinews and the corpuscles sang in my\n\t\tveins. Answers? No answers: fate had dealt me a dog turd and I\n\t\tread it as a full house. No answers, just the dead timing of\n\t\tthose twin tomb-black, doom-muffled husbands of decay,\n\t\tBitterness and Rice. But then, then: opportunity knocked once\n\t\tfor no, twice for yes. The labial seam of lead-grey cloud\n\t\topened its fiery slit and showed me one glimpse, one escape,\n\t\tone chance to cut and run and never look back, no not once,\n\t\tjust run, dead-run, blind-run. Fortune shat gold and told me\n\t\tunder whose pillow to hide it. No wives now, no children, they\n\t\thad all grown up, got married themselves, got safe oh-so-\n\t\tspittingly-secure jobs and retired to golf-villas in the\n\t\tAlgarve with beige cardigans, Beefeater and slimline and\n\t\theavily descended testicles.

If I didn\'t\n\t\ttake that chance what would I be? What would I become? Just\n\t\tanother friendless acid spot on the back buttock of a weeping\n\t\tsociety. So I took it, took the chance, picked up the ball and\n\t\tran, went for it, threw caution to the teeth of the gale, never\n\t\tlook back, just keep running, I did it.

A Modern\n\t\tBritain is like the classical Old Fashioned, but with a new\n\t\ttwist. For a Modern Britain, you\'ll need finely made English\n\t\thand-blown crystal glasses, the very best Islay malt whiskey,\n\t\tbred and lovingly blended by craftsmen who care: you\'ll need\n\t\tfreshly squeezed apple juice from pleasant Somerset orchards, a\n\t\tquarter gill of London gin, a pint of rich Jersey cream, a half\n\t\tquart of soft, still Welsh mountain water, and to garnish, a\n\t\tshamrock, a daffoldil, a thistle and a rose. To complete the\n\t\tModern Britain we add to this kindly, noble, honourable and\n\t\tcivilised mixture a centilitre of flat cola-style syrup, a\n\t\thectare of low-cal brand sweetener, a pot of non-dairy\n\t\twhitener, a leisure-sachet of instant heritage, a two-parent\n\t\tfamily size pack of diluted good values, free-market\n\t\tvegetables, a greedy helping of self-governing trusts and a\n\t\tplastic ice-cube for cosmetic purposes only. The product should\n\t\tbe half-baked at an immoderate temperature of the lowest common\n\t\tdenominator in an atmosphere of greasy cant and corrupt sleaze,\n\t\tuntil richly dishonoured and seared with shame. Your Modern\n\t\tBritain will ideally have lost all colour, flavour and fizz by\n\t\tnow and should then be divided against itself and left in\n\t\tshoddy disrepair for a number of years until it rots before\n\t\tbeing sold off to the highest bidder. An ideal self-serving\n\t\tsuggestion would be to accompany the whole botched cocktail\n\t\twith a raft of unappetising sound-bites and a package of feeble\n\t\tinitiatives stuffed with tasteless media slime. But perhaps,\n\t\tsomewhere, you might be inspired to add one small, tender,\n\t\tcaring cherry of hope. I wonder. While you decide, I will\n\t\tentreat for the very finalest of last, last times, this\n\t\tentreaty of m\'colleague, Britain\'s own Melody Man as I say,\n\t\t""Please, oh please, for all our sakes, please Mr Music, will\n\t\tyou play?""\n\t\t\n'}, {'speaker': 'direction', 'text': '\n\tHugh plays.
